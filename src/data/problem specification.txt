P2. Lab problems
A teacher manages information about students and lab problems.
Create an application which allows to: 
    perform CRUD operations on students and lab problems
    assign problems to students; assign grades
    filter entities based on various criteria
    reports: e.g. find the problem that was assigned most times

Lab 2-4
design the solution for your problem using a CASE tool (use cases, class diagram, sequence diagram for each use case)
    use feature driven development
    layered architecture
    data validation
    all functions will be documented and tested

    use Java 8 features (lambda expressions, streams etc); the program should be written without if statements and loops
    persistence: ‘in memory’, text files, xml, db (jdbc); you may use any RDBMS, but we only offer support for PostgreSQL; MS SQL Server is forbidden
